# SLP Parser
Parses slp files. Not everything is parsed, only the information needed in rwing.
Orders of magnitude faster with fewer dependencies than peppi.
Supports the slpz format.
Supports reading and writing notes to slp/slpz files.
Does not support stream based parsing.
WIP work on parsing into higher level actions (wavedash, SHFFL nair, ledgedash, etc.).

Not the cleanest code, take inspiration if you want, but please don't use this library.
